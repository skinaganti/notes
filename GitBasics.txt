
1. at command line, goto directory with files to be version controlled

2. initialize Git so you can start using Git commands inside the directory:

git init

the directory is now a Git repository

3.  to view untracked files and changes not staged for commit:

git status

4.  to track an untracked file:

git add 'filename'
(file will be moved from 'Untracked files' section to 'Changes to be committed:' section)

5.  to stage a modified file that has not yet been staged for commit:

git add 'filename'
(file will be moved from 'Changes not staged for commit' section to 'Changes to be committed:' section)

6.  to take a 'snapshot' of the repository as it stands now:

git commit -m "Some text to explain commit"

7.  to sync changes to GitHub repo:

git remote add origin
https://address/of/GitHub/repo

8.  verify origin:

git remote -v

9.  upload files to repo:

git push
